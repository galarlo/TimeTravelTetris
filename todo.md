* Incentivize player to time travel: build a game board completely filled except for one column, then shuffle the moves to create it, then provide the necessery tall-blocks to clear all lines. The player should rearrange the shuffled almost-filled board, then drop the tall-blocks and win. see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover#Pentomino_tiling and https://github.com/taylorjg/pentominoes
* Friendlier UI for time travel - maybe show more moves in a single board? (use colors and gradients)
* Meta-score (the score you gained only because of time travel)
